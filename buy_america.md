A short list of things I use and like that were built in America.

# Biking

* [Vornado 293 heavy duty fan](https://www.vornado.com/shop/made-in-usa/circulators/293-heavy-duty-large-air-circulator) - for staying cool while exercising indoors

# Kids Stuff

* [Twin mattress](https://www.costco.com/juniper-kids'-6%22-mattress.product.100365848.html) - for the kid bed
